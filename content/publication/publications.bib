	abstract = {Over the past century, U.S. field crop farmers have controlled weeds with progressively less costly technologies, moving from hoeing and draft cultivation to motorized cultivation to selective herbicides to broad-spectrum herbicides associated with herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops. The advent of herbicides had the effect of reducing both capital and labor costs by reducing the number of field passes required for effective motorized weed control. The advent of HT crops again reduced both labor and capital costs. These innovations have attracted widespread adoption by farmers. Today, HT crops and broad-spectrum weed control are used by virtually all field crop farmers except those producing for markets that will not accept genetically modified crops. The accelerating spread of herbicide-resistant weeds (an adaptive evolutionary response to extensive reliance on a few herbicides) is triggering U.S. farmers to increase and diversify their herbicide use, increasing both financial costs and selected health and environmental risks.},

	volume = {In press},
	abstract = {Agricultural nutrient runoff and leaching into groundwater can impose societal costs that may be external to farmer decisions.  Farmers can reduce the environmental impact of nutrient losses by adopting conservation and precision nutrient diagnostic and application practices.  We examine the determinants of adoption decisions of such practices using mail survey data from a large, stratified sample of corn and soybean farmers in the U.S. Eastern Corn Belt.  Via an ordered probit that captures both adoption and intent to adopt eight different practices, we evaluate a broad range of potential factors driving adoption of conservation and precision agriculture practices.  We find that farmer objectives other than income, such as preferences for environmental amenities or social status, were important adoption drivers for conservation and precision technologies, respectively.  Livestock farms had a distinct adoption profile, with greater likelihood to adopt cover cropping and less to adopt precision technologies.  Farmers who participated in working lands programs were more likely to adopt both cover cropping and precision soil testing technologies.  Policies and messaging to encourage voluntary adoption of practices to reduce agricultural nutrient loss should account for farmer objectives, farming systems, and existing policy incentives.},

	title = {Are {Glyphosate}-{Resistant} {Weeds} a {Threat} to {Conservation} {Agriculture}? {Evidence} from {Tillage} {Practices} in {Soybean}},
	volume = {In review},
	abstract = {The use of conservation tillage in American soybean production has become increasingly common since the 1950’s, improving soil health, reducing soil erosion, and reducing fuel consumption. This trend has been reinforced by the availability of the general-purpose herbicide glyphosate and glyphosate-resistant seed genetics since the mid-1990’s. Weeds have since evolved to resist glyphosate, reducing its effectiveness. In this paper, we provide evidence that the spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds is responsible for significant reductions in the use of conservation tillage in soybean production. To capture the effects of glyphosate-resistant weeds on tillage adoption, we estimate a probit model of tillage choice, using a large panel of field-level soybean management decisions from across the United States, spanning 1999-2016. We find that while the first two glyphosate-resistant weed species have little effect on tillage practices, by the time that eight glyphosate-resistant weed species are present, conservation tillage use falls by 5.7 percentage points and no-tillage use falls by 10.0 percentage points. Using a simple benefit transfer model to illustrate how these results can be applied, we conservatively estimate that between 2005 and 2016, farmers’ tillage responses to the spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds have caused water quality and climate damages valued at nearly \$390 million. This total is likely to grow as glyphosate-resistance becomes more widespread and farmers continue to turn to tillage for supplemental weed control.},

	title = {Measuring the {Effects} of {Pesticide} {Technology} {Change} on {Midwestern} {Butterfly} {Populations}},
	abstract = {Changing pesticide use is frequently implicated as a driver of declines in butterfly abundance. Existing empirical evidence of linkages between pesticide use and butterfly abundance is limited to studies that fail to account for the full suite of pesticides used by farmers, which fail to account for the effects of substitute pesticides. In this paper, we bring together data on the use of the six principal pesticide groups on corn and soybean fields and butterfly abundance data to create a unique county-level panel dataset spanning the 60 counties in the American Midwest over 17 years. We estimate count data models of total butterfly abundance and the abundance of three important species to measure the effects of each pesticide group. We find that neonicotinoids, a group of systemic insecticides applied to corn and soybean seeds before planting, have a strong negative association with total butterfly abundance and two of our three indicator species. Further, we find a positive association between the planting Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) traited corn seeds and butterfly abundance, though only in counties with large areas of cropland where interaction between butterflies and affected cropland is likely. We estimate that farmers’ changes in pesticide use since 1998 has accounted for a 9\% decrease in overall butterfly abundance in the median county in our sample, driven by a shift towards neonicotinoid seed treatments since the mid-2000s.},

	title = {Potential {Supply} of {Midwest} {Cropland} for {Conversion} to {In}-{Field} {Prairie} {Strips}},
	abstract = {Prairie strips planted into crop fields can provide ecosystem services to society by promoting habitat for beneficial species and by decreasing nutrient runoff and soil erosion. However, prairie strips also introduce private costs to the farmer who plants them. While much is known about prairie strips’ costs and benefits, less is known about how willing farmers are to plant prairie strips into their fields. I help fill this gap in the literature 1) by measuring farmer willingness to supply land for prairie strips in response to payments, 2) by estimating how farmer perceptions and farm traits impact farmers’ willingness to adopt prairie strips, and 3) by generalizing farmer willingness to adopt to calculate the land area that farmers would offer for prairie strips under several payment scenarios. This analysis uses a survey of U.S. corn and soybean farmers in the four Eastern Corn Belt states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio. The survey asked respondents if they would enroll in a contract to plant prairie strips on 5\% of the respondent’s largest field. In exchange, the farmer would receive a payment ranging from 50\% to 300\% of the state mean Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) payment rate. Using data from 487 responses, I find that farmer willingness to enroll in this hypothetical program increases with the payment offer. Further, willingness to enroll increases with farmer perceptions that prairie strips will increase soil retention and that prairie strips will increase crop yields. Using my results, I am able to construct projected supply curves across these four states detailing the corn and soybean acreage that farmers would enroll in a prairie strip program if incentive payments were offered. I find that nearly 308,000 acres of corn and soybean across these four states could be allocated toward prairie strips under payments equivalent to 100\% of CRP in-state rental payment averages, for a total annual program cost of \$41.2 million.},
