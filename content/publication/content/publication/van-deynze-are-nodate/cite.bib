 abstract = {The use of conservation tillage in American soybean production has become increasingly common since the 1950’s, improving soil health, reducing soil erosion, and reducing fuel consumption. This trend has been reinforced by the availability of the general-purpose herbicide glyphosate and glyphosate-resistant seed genetics since the mid-1990’s. Weeds have since evolved to resist glyphosate, reducing its effectiveness. In this paper, we provide evidence that the spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds is responsible for significant reductions in the use of conservation tillage in soybean production. To capture the effects of glyphosate-resistant weeds on tillage adoption, we estimate a probit model of tillage choice, using a large panel of field-level soybean management decisions from across the United States, spanning 1999-2016. We find that while the first two glyphosate-resistant weed species have little effect on tillage practices, by the time that eight glyphosate-resistant weed species are present, conservation tillage use falls by 5.7 percentage points and no-tillage use falls by 10.0 percentage points. Using a simple benefit transfer model to illustrate how these results can be applied, we conservatively estimate that between 2005 and 2016, farmers’ tillage responses to the spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds have caused water quality and climate damages valued at nearly \$390 million. This total is likely to grow as glyphosate-resistance becomes more widespread and farmers continue to turn to tillage for supplemental weed control.},
